# 🧠 Optional Layer: Cognitive Interfaces
# Allow the toolkit to learn, adapt, and refine understanding of signal "language":
#
# LLM-assisted signal annotation (“describe what this pattern might mean”)
# Reinforcement loops: “Did you interpret this correctly?”
# Context-based signal clustering (unsupervised)
