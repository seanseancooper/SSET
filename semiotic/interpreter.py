# Semiotic Layer: Meaning, Context, Intent
# Interpret the signal as a communicative act. What system is speaking? Whatâ€™s its intent or function?
#
# Emitter profiling: Who/what emits this?
# Temporal behavior: When and how often does it transmit?
# Spatial analysis: Where is it, where is it pointed?
# Intent modeling: What operational purpose is this signal serving?
