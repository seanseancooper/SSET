        # One of the aspects associated with amplitude modulation is sidebands are generated.

        # one either side of the main carrier spaced by 1 kHz away from it.

        # Similarly if modulation with a variety of frequencies, e.g. speech or music is used, then the sidebands
        # will spread out either side of the carrier, extended out by an amount equal to the top frequencies used

        r"""FFT-based computation of the analytic signal.

        The analytic signal is calculated by filtering out the negative frequencies and
        doubling the amplitudes of the positive frequencies in the FFT domain.
        The imaginary part of the result is the hilbert transform of the real-valued input
        signal.

        The transformation is done along the last axis by default.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : array_like
            Signal data.  Must be real.
        N : int, optional
            Number of Fourier components.  Default: ``x.shape[axis]``
        axis : int, optional
            Axis along which to do the transformation.  Default: -1.

        Return the Discrete Fourier Transform sample frequencies.

        The returned float array `f` contains the frequency bin centers in cycles
        per unit of the sample spacing (with zero at the start).  For instance, if
        the sample spacing is in seconds, then the frequency unit is cycles/second.

          f = [0, 1, ...,   n/2-1,     -n/2, ..., -1] / (d*n)   if n is even

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Window length.
        d : scalar, optional
            Sample spacing (inverse of the sampling rate). Defaults to 1.
        device : str, optional
            The device on which to place the created array. Default: ``None``.
            For Array-API interoperability only, so must be ``"cpu"`` if passed.
