# Transposition Layer: Making the Invisible Perceivable
# Convert raw EM data into formats that can be sensed and interacted with:
#
# Audio renderings of RF/IF signals (sonification)
# Spectrogram visualizations
# Synthetic vision of SAR or IR signals
# Volumetric/haptic representations (optional / future)
#
# Spectrogram visualizations
# specviz.py: Real-time spectrogram with event annotation.
