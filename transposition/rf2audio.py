# Transposition Layer: Making the Invisible Perceivable
# rf2audio.py: Convert I/Q samples to WAV for human listening.



# Convert raw EM data into formats that can be sensed and interacted with:
#
# Audio renderings of RF/IF signals (sonification)
# Spectrogram visualizations
# Synthetic vision of SAR or IR signals
# Volumetric/haptic representations (optional / future)
#
#


# takes RF energy and creates an array of that data as audio.
# read a segment of spectrum from SDR stick.
# demodulate it into audible audio ala 'record the radio'
# RF to audio: In SIGINT or spectrum analysis, demodulated audio is just RF rendered in a perceptible form.


# idea: semantic delta wrt 'sonify_signal.py'
