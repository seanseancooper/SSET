# Signal Semiotics Toolkit

## Overview

This toolkit explores a foundational approach to interpreting electromagnetic (EM) emissions as a form of language.
We frame signal analysis through two core concepts: **transposition** (making signals perceptible) and
**transformation** (making signals intelligible).

By treating EM emissions as communicative acts rather than just data or interference, we gain affordances in analysis,
understanding, and potentially interaction. This approach draws from semiotics, signal processing, cognitive electronic
warfare, and information theory.

## Key Concepts

### Transposition
Convert EM emissions into a perceptible form:
- Audio renderings
- Visualizations (spectrograms, spatial mappings)
- Synthetic sensory interfaces (future work)

### Transformation
Apply algorithms or models to extract meaning:
- Modulation classification
- Protocol/bitstream decoding
- Behavioral and temporal modeling

### Signal Semiotics
Interpret EM fields as meaningful symbols:
- What system is speaking?
- What behavior is occurring?
- What is the emitter's intent?

## Toward a Theory of Signal Semiotics

Traditionally, signal analysis emphasizes decoding and classification. But if we take a step back, we see that every signal is a communicative act—embedded in a system of meaning.

A theoretical signal can be decomposed into three layers:

1. **Bias**: The structured, persistent signature or fingerprint of the emitter. This includes its choice of frequency, modulation, timing, and behavior. Bias encodes *intent*, *identity*, and *design constraints*. It is the emitter's grammar or dialect.

2. **Variance**: These are the modulations and variations around the bias that convey specific instances of content or behavior. This is where meaning fluctuates and where one can observe the "speech" or message, framed within the emitter's grammar.

3. **Noise**: Traditionally viewed as meaningless, noise can still carry semantic weight—especially when analyzed ecologically. Noise may reflect interference, jamming, multipath effects, or even deception. In a semiotic context, noise may be unintentional expression, or ambient context.

This mirrors linguistic and semiotic theory:
- **Bias** ≈ Syntax / Language Rules
- **Variance** ≈ Message / Utterance
- **Noise** ≈ Paralinguistic or Environmental Expression

When we acknowledge EM emissions as language-like, we gain new methods of interpreting them:
- Not just what a signal says, but **how** it says it.
- Not just whether a signal is present, but **why** it behaves that way.
- Not just identifying modulation, but **inferring motive or state**.

This model builds a foundation for tools that don't just classify signals—they *interpret* them.
